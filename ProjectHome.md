This project is a VSTO document-level customization (Word document in Office 2010) to allow users to easily create quizzes in Microsoft Word and export them to Moodle's XML format, for import in Moodle.

2014-02-20 There is a branch for a VSTO document-level customization (Word document in Office 2010) for building under Visual Studio 2013. To build it, use VisualSVN to "Get Solution from Subversion" and point to the /branches/VS2013 branch. There may be warnings about the solution file, but in my tests under Windows 8.1 and Windows 7, I was still able to build. I'd appreciate other feedback if you have trouble.

2014-02-23 I don't think XSD can work to do detailed validations of XML generated by this tool. See the following discussion for the details: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=254950

## Installation / Updates ##
The solution now is a VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) Document-level customization (in Word). **It requires .NET 4.0** as well as some VSTO 2010 files to run.

To successfully install this on your Windows machine, follow these steps:
  * In Windows, add `http://profs.etsmtl.ca/` to the "Trusted Sites" zone (do not require https:). For more information, see [how to add sites to zones](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-zones-adding-removing-websites).
  * In Internet Explorer (I'm not sure it works with other browsers), download and run [setup.exe](http://profs.etsmtl.ca/cfuhrman/MoodleQuestions/setup.exe).
    * You should see a warning that the _Publisher cannot be verified_. This is normal because currently there is no certificate for this tool. However, you can verify that it's indeed <br><b>From: <code>http://profs.etsmtl.ca/cfuhrman/MoodleQuestions/MoodleQuestions.vsto</code></b><br>If you don't trust this tool, then do not install it.<br>
</li></ul>  * Download the [customized Word document](http://profs.etsmtl.ca/cfuhrman/MoodleQuestions/MoodleQuestions.docm) to start creating your quiz questions.

> _If you have trouble installing with the SETUP.EXE file, you can alternately 1) Uninstall the installation if you installed an older version, and/or 2) try installing the [MoodleQuestions.vsto](http://profs.etsmtl.ca/cfuhrman/MoodleQuestions/MoodleQuestions.vsto)._

Note this version comes with no guarantees of its stability. Use at your own risk.
